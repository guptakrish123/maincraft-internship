# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of my internship Task-1 in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.  
The objective is to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model using the California Housing dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Understand complete Machine Learning workflow
- Perform data loading, exploration, preprocessing
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model using MAE, RMSE, and R² score

---

## 📊 Dataset

- California Housing Dataset  
- Source: Built-in dataset from `scikit-learn`

Target Variable: `MedHouseVal` (Median House Value)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded California Housing dataset
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained Linear Regression model
6. Evaluated model using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
7. Plotted Actual vs Predicted values

---

## 📈 Results

The model was able to predict house prices with reasonable accuracy using Linear Regression.  
Evaluation metrics were calculated and visualized in the notebook.
